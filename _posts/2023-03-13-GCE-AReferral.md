**Hey everyone!**

We have decided on implementing a referral system for the Grand Canonical Ensemble.

<!--more-->

The rules are as follows:

- Every student will have a unique referral code, which is their roll number. (MS21001 for example)

- At the end of any event, the attendees are asked if they were referred to the event. If yes, we ask for the referral codes of those that referred them to the event.

- At most, two unique referral codes can be provided by an attendee for that particular event.

- You cannot use your own referral code.

At the end of GCE, the students whose referral code will be declared winners (and we have something in store for them as well..)

PS: **It's completely optional**. You don't need to be referred to in order to participate in any event.

Look forward to seeing you at the events!

Warm regards,<br>
