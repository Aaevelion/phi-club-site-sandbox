Hullo,


Grab your flashlights and tighten your hunting boots, Phi@I is back with the best treasure hunt of the year.

<!--more-->

Prerequisites -

- Basic knowledge in physics
- Covered shoes (cuz snakes and rodents)
- Some Breinz
- Need for money

With clues more complicated than your situationships, a laptop will come handy but not as much as your drive for the prize.


If food for thought isnâ€™t motivating enough, come for the big fat Rs 2k prize pool.


Come in teams of 3-4 to H5 study room at 10pm sharp for your first clue!


Bring Your Own Coffee!
