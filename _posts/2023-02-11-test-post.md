## Talk of the Week 02

What: Quantum Drunkards and their Quantum Walks 

Who: Dhruva Sambrani (MS18 batch)

When and Where: LH3, 7 pm, 17th November 2022 (Tomorrow!)



Abstract: Random walks are a very simple kind of stochastic process, but even the simplest walks show a variety of properties. That said though, Random walks have been studied forever, and a (relatively) recent field of study is that of the quantum analogue of these walks, which have shown to speed up a class of algorithms, most notably the Grover Search. To both these kinds of walks, we introduce something called resetting, and this changes certain properties of the walks. This talk will explore these topics in 3 sections.



Hoping to see you guys in huge numbers!!
